# Blog Poster

## Description

This app presents users with a MVC modelled blogging page that one can create an account on, log in and out of, create posts, browse a homepage of posts from other users, and comment on posts. This uses a server, database, cookies, Express, and more to run.

## Usage

To use this app, visit the page here; /HEROKU LINK TBA/. Create an account, then browse the homepage to see what users have posted, make your own post, or comment on existing posts. Users can also delete or edit posts and comments.

## Future

I would like to add onto this by further expanding on the CSS to represent the theme idea of the wireframe, as the current CSS is a basic version. Along with this, I would like to add an image to upload images and videos alongside posts, following users, and choosing formats of post to range from text input to list input and more.

## Test

A test video will be included with the README.
